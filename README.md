🤔 So what do I do? Basically it depends on mood.
- Some days I find myself on high adrenaline and work on python and others and make a stupid project out of it (sometimes turns out to be really useful). Stupid projects are like stupid errors which we try to fix for hours and later find out it was a typo mistake, but according to me these things teach us the most so I never stop exploring.
- I will not lie, Obviosuly I do not code whole day otherwise who is living life. Few days I find myself on couch and research about Financial Markets and try to gain financial knowledge because according to me 
  > **"Financial literacy is to life what "Hello World" is to coding."**
